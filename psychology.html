                        As being a part of the Art Therapist, I learn that doodle can release your stress and reduced negativity. Doodle also can make someone express themselves in a creative way. Some doodle can reveal who you are from what you love or usually draw. It can reveal your personality. If, you never doodle, you can start to try and feel it yourself how it is going to feel afterwards. It is more effective if you out colours into your doodle. If you are doodle during class or meeting, it is actually can improve your focus and memory. By doodling during classes, you can know whether you are visual, auditory or kinaesthetic person. Sometimes, you will learn about yourself with doodle. You can see the other perspective of yourself, with the colours used to show your emotion also could help you to find something new in yourself. By express in a paper by doodling, it could help you to overcome your stress or depression. As in doodle, you can express it in artistic ways instead of write your own diary.
